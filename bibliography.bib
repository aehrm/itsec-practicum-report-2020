	title = {A Quantitative Analysis of the Impact of Arbitrary Blockchain Content on Bitcoin},
	abstract = {Blockchains primarily enable credible accounting of digital events, e.g., money transfers in cryptocurrencies. However, beyond this original purpose, blockchains also irrevocably record arbitrary data, ranging from short messages to pictures. This does not come without risk for users as each participant has to locally replicate the complete blockchain, particularly including potentially harmful content. We provide the ﬁrst systematic analysis of the beneﬁts and threats of arbitrary blockchain content. Our analysis shows that certain content, e.g., illegal pornography, can render the mere possession of a blockchain illegal. Based on these insights, we conduct a thorough quantitative and qualitative analysis of unintended content on Bitcoin’s blockchain. Although most data originates from benign extensions to Bitcoin’s protocol, our analysis reveals more than 1600 ﬁles on the blockchain, over 99 \% of which are texts or images. Among these ﬁles there is clearly objectionable content such as links to child pornography, which is distributed to all Bitcoin participants. With our analysis, we thus highlight the importance for future blockchain designs to address the possibility of unintended data insertion and protect blockchain users accordingly.},

	abstract = {A chameleon-hash function is a hash function that involves a trapdoor the knowledge of which allows one to ﬁnd arbitrary collisions in the domain of the function. In this paper, we introduce the notion of chameleon-hash functions with ephemeral trapdoors. Such hash functions feature additional, i.e., ephemeral, trapdoors which are chosen by the party computing a hash value. The holder of the main trapdoor is then unable to ﬁnd a second pre-image of a hash value unless also provided with the ephemeral trapdoor used to compute the hash value. We present a formal security model for this new primitive as well as provably secure instantiations. The ﬁrst instantiation is a generic black-box construction from any secure chameleon-hash function. We further provide three direct constructions based on standard assumptions. Our new primitive has some appealing use-cases, including a solution to the long-standing open problem of invisible sanitizable signatures, which we also present.},

As we argue, there are several reasons to prefer an editable blockchain, spanning from the necessity to remove inappropriate content and the possibility to support applications requiring re-writable storage, to “the right to be forgotten.” Our approach generically leverages so-called chameleon hash functions (Krawczyk and Rabin, {NDSS} ’00), which allow determining hash collisions eﬃciently, given a secret trapdoor information. We detail how to integrate a chameleon hash function in virtually any blockchain-based technology, for both cases where the power of redacting the blockchain content is in the hands of a single trusted entity and where such a capability is distributed among several distrustful parties (as is the case with Bitcoin).},

@report{puddu_chain:_2017,
	title = {{µchain: How to Forget without Hard Forks}},
	abstract = {In this paper, we explore an idea of making (proof-of-work) blockchains mutable. We propose and implement µchain, a mutable blockchain, that enables modiﬁcations of blockchain history. Blockchains are, by common deﬁnition, distributed and immutable data structures that store a history of events, such as transactions in a digital currency system. While the very idea of mutable event history may seem controversial at a ﬁrst glance, we show that µchain does not undermine security guarantees provided by immutable blockchains. In particular, all mutations in our system are controlled by ﬁat, enforced by consensus and are veriﬁable in the same way as regular transactions. At the same time, µchain provides a solution to a number of challenging problems, such as the patching of vulnerable smart contracts and removal of abusive content from blockchain history. It also gives rise to new blockchain applications that were not possible with immutable blockchains. For instance, governments and companies could now maintain registers of citizens and customers, while preserving their legislated rights to be forgotten. Banks could consider consolidation of cryptocurrency with traditional payments, which is hard to achieve without the ability to revert transactions. To further illustrate the power of µchain on more concrete examples, we present two new applications, the collaborative recommendation system with the ability to censor inappropriate content, and a time-lock encryption mechanism that provides a method to decrypt messages after a certain deadline has passed.},

	abstract = {Bitcoin has revolutionized digital currencies and its underlying blockchain has been successfully applied to other domains. To be veriﬁable by every participating peer, the blockchain maintains every transaction in a persistent, distributed, and tamper-proof log that every participant needs to replicate locally. While this constitutes the central innovation of blockchain technology and is thus a desired property, it can also be abused in ways that are harmful to the overall system. We show for Bitcoin that blockchains potentially provide multiple ways to store (malicious and illegal) content that, once stored, cannot be removed and is replicated by every participating user. We study the evolution of content storage in Bitcoin’s blockchain, classify the stored content, and highlight implications of allowing the storage of arbitrary data in globally replicated blockchains.},

	doi = {10.1109/IC2E.2018.00070},
	abstract = {Since the introduction of Bitcoin in 2008, blockchain systems have seen an enormous increase in adoption. By providing a persistent, distributed, and append-only ledger, blockchains enable numerous applications such as distributed consensus, robustness against equivocation, and smart contracts. However, recent studies show that blockchain systems such as Bitcoin can be (mis)used to store arbitrary content. This has already been used to store arguably objectionable content on Bitcoin’s blockchain. Already single instances of clearly objectionable or even illegal content can put the whole system at risk by making its node operators culpable. To overcome this imminent risk, we survey and discuss the design space of countermeasures against the insertion of such objectionable content. Our analysis shows a wide spectrum of potential countermeasures, which are often combinable for increased efﬁciency. First, we investigate special-purpose content detectors as an ad hoc mitigation. As they turn out to be easily evadable, we also investigate content-agnostic countermeasures. We ﬁnd that mandatory minimum fees as well as mitigation of transaction manipulability via identiﬁer commitments signiﬁcantly raise the bar for inserting harmful content into a blockchain.},
