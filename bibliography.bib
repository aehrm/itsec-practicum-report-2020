	title = {A Quantitative Analysis of the Impact of Arbitrary Blockchain Content on Bitcoin},
	abstract = {Blockchains primarily enable credible accounting of digital events, e.g., money transfers in cryptocurrencies. However, beyond this original purpose, blockchains also irrevocably record arbitrary data, ranging from short messages to pictures. This does not come without risk for users as each participant has to locally replicate the complete blockchain, particularly including potentially harmful content. We provide the ﬁrst systematic analysis of the beneﬁts and threats of arbitrary blockchain content. Our analysis shows that certain content, e.g., illegal pornography, can render the mere possession of a blockchain illegal. Based on these insights, we conduct a thorough quantitative and qualitative analysis of unintended content on Bitcoin’s blockchain. Although most data originates from benign extensions to Bitcoin’s protocol, our analysis reveals more than 1600 ﬁles on the blockchain, over 99 \% of which are texts or images. Among these ﬁles there is clearly objectionable content such as links to child pornography, which is distributed to all Bitcoin participants. With our analysis, we thus highlight the importance for future blockchain designs to address the possibility of unintended data insertion and protect blockchain users accordingly.},

In this paper, we introduce the notion of chameleon-hash functions with ephemeral trapdoors. Such hash functions feature additional, i.e., ephemeral, trapdoors which are chosen by the party computing a hash value. The holder of the main trapdoor is then unable to ﬁnd a second pre-image of a hash value unless also provided with the ephemeral trapdoor used to compute the hash value. We present a formal security model for this new primitive as well as provably secure instantiations. The ﬁrst instantiation is a generic black-box construction from any secure chameleon-hash function. We further provide three direct constructions based on standard assumptions. Our new primitive has some appealing use-cases, including a solution to the long-standing open problem of invisible sanitizable signatures, which we also present.},

As we argue, there are several reasons to prefer an editable blockchain, spanning from the necessity to remove inappropriate content and the possibility to support applications requiring re-writable storage, to “the right to be forgotten.” Our approach generically leverages so-called chameleon hash functions (Krawczyk and Rabin, {NDSS} ’00), which allow determining hash collisions eﬃciently, given a secret trapdoor information. We detail how to integrate a chameleon hash function in virtually any blockchain-based technology, for both cases where the power of redacting the blockchain content is in the hands of a single trusted entity and where such a capability is distributed among several distrustful parties (as is the case with Bitcoin).},

	title = {{µchain: How to Forget without Hard Forks}},
	abstract = {In this paper, we explore an idea of making (proof-of-work) blockchains mutable. We propose and implement µchain, a mutable blockchain, that enables modiﬁcations of blockchain history. Blockchains are, by common deﬁnition, distributed and immutable data structures that store a history of events, such as transactions in a digital currency system. While the very idea of mutable event history may seem controversial at a ﬁrst glance, we show that µchain does not undermine security guarantees provided by immutable blockchains. In particular, all mutations in our system are controlled by ﬁat, enforced by consensus and are veriﬁable in the same way as regular transactions. At the same time, µchain provides a solution to a number of challenging problems, such as the patching of vulnerable smart contracts and removal of abusive content from blockchain history. It also gives rise to new blockchain applications that were not possible with immutable blockchains. For instance, governments and companies could now maintain registers of citizens and customers, while preserving their legislated rights to be forgotten. Banks could consider consolidation of cryptocurrency with traditional payments, which is hard to achieve without the ability to revert transactions. To further illustrate the power of µchain on more concrete examples, we present two new applications, the collaborative recommendation system with the ability to censor inappropriate content, and a time-lock encryption mechanism that provides a method to decrypt messages after a certain deadline has passed.},

To be veriﬁable by every participating peer, the blockchain maintains every transaction in a persistent, distributed, and tamper-proof log that every participant needs to replicate locally. While this constitutes the central innovation of blockchain technology and is thus a desired property, it can also be abused in ways that are harmful to the overall system. We show for Bitcoin that blockchains potentially provide multiple ways to store (malicious and illegal) content that, once stored, cannot be removed and is replicated by every participating user. We study the evolution of content storage in Bitcoin’s blockchain, classify the stored content, and highlight implications of allowing the storage of arbitrary data in globally replicated blockchains.},

	abstract = {Since the introduction of Bitcoin in 2008, blockchain systems have seen an enormous increase in adoption. By providing a persistent, distributed, and append-only ledger, blockchains enable numerous applications such as distributed consensus, robustness against equivocation, and smart contracts. However, recent studies show that blockchain systems such as Bitcoin can be (mis)used to store arbitrary content. This has already been used to store arguably objectionable content on Bitcoin’s blockchain. Already single instances of clearly objectionable or even illegal content can put the whole system at risk by making its node operators culpable. To overcome this imminent risk, we survey and discuss the design space of countermeasures against the insertion of such objectionable content. Our analysis shows a wide spectrum of potential countermeasures, which are often combinable for increased efﬁciency. First, we investigate special-purpose content detectors as an ad hoc mitigation. As they turn out to be easily evadable, we also investigate content-agnostic countermeasures. We ﬁnd that mandatory minimum fees as well as mitigation of transaction manipulability via identiﬁer commitments signiﬁcantly raise the bar for inserting harmful content into a blockchain.},

	abstract = {The immutability of the blockchain technology facilitates it to establish a general consensus in a trustless environment, enabling a wide range of new applications, including distributed general-purpose data management and digital data sharing marketplace. This immutability, however, presents disadvantages for the blockchain technology, when it is used in other areas where the modification of data in blockchain is demanded. In this study, we propose a method for building modifiable blockchains in decentralized public network. To be specific, in computing the hash value of the block, the proposed method uses truncated hash values (these are called `target values' in this paper) of the transactions that are modifiable upon future requests, instead of transactions themselves. By doing so, the proposed method provides an opportunity to modify those transactions by making truncated hash values of modified versions equal to their original target values. The proposed method uses several cryptographic techniques to prevent the modification of the transaction from being performed for malicious purposes, and a multichain structure to improve the efficiency in transaction modification. By accommodating the modification feature to the blockchain, proposed architecture complies to key demands of the data protection regulations such as `right to rectification', `right to withdraw consent', and `right to be forgotten', et cetera. In addition, detailed threat analysis demonstrates that the proposed truncated hash-based modification is sufficiently secure to open up a wide range of new blockchain based services through added modifiability feature.},

	abstract = {Bitcoin is the first successful decentralized global digital cash system. Its mining process requires intense computational resources, therefore its usefulness remains a disputable topic. We aim to solve three problems with Bitcoin and other blockchain systems of today by repurposing their work. First, space to store a blockchain is growing linearly with number of transactions. Second, a honest node is forced to be irrational regarding storing full blocks by a way implementations are done. Third, a trustless bootstrapping process for a new node involves downloading and processing all the transactions ever written into a blockchain. In this paper we present a new consensus protocol for Bitcoin-like peer-to-peer systems where a right to generate a block is given to a party providing non-interactive proofs of storing a subset of the past state snapshots. Unlike the blockchain systems in use today, a network using our protocol is safe if the nodes prune full blocks not needed for mining. We extend the {GKL} model to describe our Proof-of-Work scheme and a transactional model modifications needed for it. We provide a detailed analysis of our protocol and proofs of its security.},

While this is a desired feature e.g. for crypto currencies, it can be a show stopper for other use cases that still require ex-post correction or removal of stored data. Existing proposals for redactable blockchains address this issue, but support the correction of specific types of stored data only. To overcome these limitations, we propose and introduce a correctable blockchain architecture that supports correction of arbitrary data. The proposed solution uses a consensus-enforced voting mechanism for decentralized decision making on requested data corrections. Information on applied corrections is stored in a second chain, which ensures that the corrected chain can still be validated successfully. We have verified the security of the proposed correctable blockchain architecture by means of a detailed security analysis. Furthermore, we have evaluated the proposed solution by means of a first reference implementation, which demonstrates the solution's feasibility. First experiments conducted with this reference implementation indicate that the added data-correction functionality has only negligible impacts on the overall performance.},

	abstract = {Blockchain technologies recently received a considerable amount of attention. While the initial focus was mainly on the use of blockchains in the context of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, application scenarios now go far beyond this. Most blockchains have the property that once some object, e.g., a block or a transaction, has been registered to be included into the blockchain, it is persisted and there are no means to modify it again. While this is an essential feature of most blockchain scenarios, it is still often desirable—at times it may be even legally required—to allow for breaking this immutability in a controlled way.},

	abstract = {We study legal and policy issues surrounding crypto currencies, such as Bitcoin, and how those issues interact with technical design options. With an interdisciplinary team, we consider in depth a variety of issues surrounding law, policy, and crypto currencies—such as the physical location where a crypto currency’s value exists for jurisdictional and other purposes, the regulation of anonymous or pseudonymous currencies, and challenges as virtual currency protocols and laws evolve. We reflect on how different technical directions may interact with the relevant laws and policies, raising key issues for both policy experts and technologists.},
